### INTRODUCTION
Utilizing Microsoft Excel, an indispensable and frequently demanded skill for the Data Analyst role, I adeptly manage to clean and manipulate raw datasets while also creating interactive dashboards. However, due to the dataset's size of over half a million rows, I encounter lags and delays. Consequently, for enhanced efficiency when analyzing large volumes of data, it is preferable to utilize other tools for convenience.

### DATA COLLECTION
For this project, I used the dataset from this source: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail),  which contains all the transactions occurring between 12/1/2010 to 12/9/2011 from a company that mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. The dataset is based in the United Kingdom and registered non-store online retail.
